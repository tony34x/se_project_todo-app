# Simple Todo App
A minimalist and intuitive task management web app that helps users quickly create, track, and complete daily tasks. Designed for simplicity and ease of use, it’s perfect for managing small to-do lists without unnecessary clutter.

## Functionality
The Simple ToDo App allows users to:

Add new tasks with optional due dates

Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted

Edit and delete tasks as needed

View progress with a counter showing completed vs total tasks

Persist tasks in the browser’s local storage so they remain after refreshing

The app uses a popup form for task creation and dynamically updates the task list, making it fast and interactive.

## Technology
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the structure, styling, and functionality

Vanilla JS modules for clean code organization

CSS BEM methodology for maintainable styles
